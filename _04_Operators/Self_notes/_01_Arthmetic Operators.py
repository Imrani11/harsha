#Python Operators:
"""Python Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables.
These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations.
In this article, we will look into different types of Python operators"""

#Arithmetic Operators
"""Arithmetic Operators are used to performing mathematical operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division."""
"""+ Addition: adds two operands x + y
– Subtraction: subtracts two operands x – y
* Multiplication: multiplies two operands x * y
/ Division (float): divides the first operand by the second x / y
// Floor division can perform both floting point and integral arithmetic
% Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is
divided by the second
x % y
** Power: Returns first raised to power second x ** y"""
