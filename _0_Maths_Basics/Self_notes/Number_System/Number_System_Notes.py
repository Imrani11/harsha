Natural
=======
Natural: Counting numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,.... Basically, all integers greater than 0 are natural numbers

Fact about Natural numbers
========================
1. They are whole numbers (called integers), and never less than zero (i.e positive numbers)
2. The next possible natural numbers can be found by adding 1 to the current natural numbers
3. The natural numbers are the ordinary numbers 1,2,3,....etc, with which we count.
4. The number zero is something consider

'''
'''
Whole Numbers
=============
The natural number starting with 0 is called a whole number. The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and (so on) are the whole numbers. 
It is the set of positive integers. It can be said that The whole number is the set of numbers without fractions, 
decimals, and negative numbers. It is set of only positive numbers including 0. 
The number smallest among the whole numbers is 0. All whole numbers are also real numbers. 
Every natural number is a Whole number but not vice-versa.

'''
Integers
=========
Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types, which means that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.

Different types of Number data types are :
1. int
2. float
3. complex
'''
'''
Rational
========
A number “x” is a rational number if it can be written in the form of “p/q” where p and q are integers (q ≠ 0). 
Any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number. Some of the examples of rational number are 1/2, 1/5, 3/4, and so on. 
The number “0” is also a rational number, as we can represent it in many forms such as 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, etc.
'''
'''
Irrrational
===========
A number “x” is called irrational if cannot be written in the form of “p/q” where p and q are integers (q ≠ 0). 
Just like there are infinitely many rational numbers, there are infinitely many irrational numbers.
Example: √2, √3, \pi

DATA TYPES :
============
- Individual values 
    --> Number system  
    --> Boolean True/False   1/0       
- Collection(Group) of individual values      
    --> Sets, Sequences, Matrices

Conversion in mathematics :
---------------------------
Conversion : Measurement: to change from one unit to another 
                          such as from inches to millimeters, or liters to gallons

Temperature:
°C	  °F	Description
37	98.6	Body temperature

Length:
            1 km = 1000 m
            1 m  = 100 cm
            1 cm = 10 mm    ==> 1KM + 100M ==>  1KM + 0.1KM = 1.1 KM**
                                               1000M + 100M = 1100 M

Mass:
            1 tonne = 1000 kg
            1 kg    = 1000 gm
            1 gm    = 1000 mg
            1 mg    = 0.0154 grain
            
Volume/Capacity:
            1 liter = 2.113 fluid pt
 

XXX ===>   2 Dozen eggs + 5 KG Rice + 3L Water + 1 KM

2Dozen + 5 Dozen = 7 Dozen
5 KG + 3KG = 8 KG 
3L water + 5L Oil = 8L

1KM + 100M  ==> 1 KM + 0.1 KM ==> 1.1 KM
            ==> 1000 M + 100 M  ==> 1100 M
            
200KM + 5M =
